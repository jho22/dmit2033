          <p>We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Take your time. Speed will come later. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.

        <div class="col">
          <p>Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? See there, told you that would be easy. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.</p>

          <p>That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>You can create anything that makes you happy. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. You can get away with a lot. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.</p>
