    <h2>Example One</h2>
    <div class="col-group">
      <div class="col">
        <p>We'll have a super time. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. All those little son of a guns. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>We'll do another happy little painting. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>Let's do that again. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Poor old tree. Only eight colors that you need. Let's have a little bit of fun today.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. You gotta think like a tree. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>Be brave. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Here's something that's fun.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. It all happens automatically. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>Don't fight it, use what happens. You are only limited by your imagination. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. It's all a game of angles. Take your time. Speed will come later. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.</p>
